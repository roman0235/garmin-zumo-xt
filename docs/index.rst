Go to Settings → Updates; device checks for available updates.

Choose Install All or select Map → Install All to update just the maps.

Accept license agreements.

Plug into power (USB wall charger ≥ 1 A recommended).

Stay connected to Wi‑Fi and power—updates can be large and take time

2. Using Garmin Express on a Computer
Install Garmin Express from Garmin’s website.

Connect the Zūmo XT via USB; select File Transfer Mode on the device.

Garmin is reportedly working on a fix; temporary workarounds exist (editing XML) but are technical and risky 


🖥 Server Connection Problems
Some users can't add the device in Garmin Express due to server errors.

Solution: Downgrade Garmin Express to version ~7.15.0 


💾 SD Card Limitations

Suggests limiting maps or using Express to manage map install order 

🧭 Tips & Best Practices
Use Wi‑Fi + charging dock for uninterrupted large map downloads.

Keep firmware updated—some fixes enable map downloads again.

Include a microSD card if device storage is low.

If you use BaseCamp for route planning, ensure maps install properly on your computer—bug fixes anticipated.

✅ Summary
Method	Pros	Cons
Wi‑Fi (On Device)	Convenient, no computer needed	Slow, needs power + network
Garmin Express	Faster, flexibley using SD card	Can be impacted by bugs/server issues

Staying on the latest firmware and using at least one of these update methods ensures your Zūmo XT always has the freshest map data—and routes you can trust. If computer‑based map management is critical, watch for Garmin's fix for the Express/BaseCamp issue.
